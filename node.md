# Routing Notes

An express router is like a Component.

We can break an express API into Routers

/api/hubs
/api/users
/api/messages
/api/lessons

REST.
- everything is a Resource.
- Resources are accessed through a single URL.

a function has a name === an endpoint has a url

you execute(invoke) a function === you send a request to an endpoint

we can pass data to a function as arguments === we can send data to an endpoint(body, url parameter, query string, header)

a function can return a value === and endpoint can return a response.
